## Recipe Keeps
Keep track of all your recipes in one single place. Users can create an account where they can add, delete, and edit their own recipes.

## Motivation
I wanted to make a tool that would allow me to keep track of family recipes. I used to save them on my notes app or write them down in multiple notebooks. I wanted one place where the focus was one's own recipes.  

## Features
- Authentication process
- Upload a recipe image
- Create/Update/Delete recipes
- Search through your recipes
